Intro:

  I currently work supporting the Storage Foundation family of products. Through the course of my day, I end up writing a bunch of little scripts and snippets to perform the repetitive heavy lifting for me. I figure that some of them might be helpful to other people. 
  
  
CAVEATS:

  This repo does not constitute any kind of official support contract, either explicit or implied. Use everything at your own risk.
